Norns mod to add `nb` voices for Whimsical Raps Just Friends.

This mod adds eight voice targets:

* 6x mono voices. One for each output of Just Friends. These support slew.

* 1x unison voice. Uses all the Just Friends outputs to produce a detuned unison super-waveform. Adjustable detune.

* 1x poly voice. Uses the internal Just Friends voice allocation. Does not have any parameters.

You can use as many different mono voices at once as you like. I will not be responsible for trying to use mono voices and other voices at the same time, or trying to use unison and poly at the same time. Seems like a silly idea.
